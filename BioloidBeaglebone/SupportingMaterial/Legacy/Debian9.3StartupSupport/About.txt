Just run 'LaunchBioloid.sh'. The rest of the following is historical. Especially ignore the note at the bottom, as this is addressed by blacklisting the UIOPRUSS on the commandline.

This file does the following:

overlayPinConfig.sh - this is a script that is run by the user before launching the main program. It does the following: loads the univeral IO and HDMI-disabling device tree overlays (sometimes referred to synonymously with capes); loads the UIO_PRUSS kernel driver and sets aside 2MB of system memory for use by the PRUs; configures all the pins necessary for PRU input, output, and UART; and configures one pin for PWM to drive the camera.

To use this file:

copy overlayPinConfig.sh to whatever directory you will be working from and make executable

Before running the main BioloidBeaglebone program, you must execute the overlayPinConfig.sh (e.g. open a terminal window, switch to the directory where you placed overlayPinConfig.sh, type ./overlayPinConfig.sh, and press enter). This only needs to be done once, and should only be done once, preferrably right after booting has completed. You should also run GRB422-QVGA.sh from the CameraManipulationScripts folder if you are using the GRB422 QVGA version of the camera code, currently the default. This must be run after overlayPinConfig.sh or it will not work.


NOTE: CURRENTLY ON 9.3, IF YOU RUN THE TWO STARTUP SCRIPTS (OVERLAYPINCONFIG.SH AND GRB422-QVGA.SH AND THEN RUN BIOLOIDBEAGLEBONE, YOU WILL GET A BLANK BLACK VIDEO FEED. YOU MUST CLOSE THE PROGRAM, RUN RMMOD UIO_PRUSS FROM A COMMAND LINE, THEN RE-RUN THE SCRIPTS. THE PROGRAM SHOULD THEN WORK NORMALLY.
